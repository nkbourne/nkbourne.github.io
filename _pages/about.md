<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at the College of Electronic Information and Optical Engineering, Nankai University, as a research associate. My research interests include deep learning, compressed sensing, image processing, Internet of Things and computer vision. I have published 10+ papers with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BUtITWcAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

Furthermore, I have a strong interest in robotics technology. I participated in the 2015 National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest, where I designed and built an autonomous quadrotor UAV, which won the National First Prize. I designed the first generation of half-size Micromouse in China in collaboration with Ruobin Wang and promoted it to the Tianjin Micromouse Challenge.
